Hi guys.
This is built as a 'collection' meaning that you can import it into an existing script, then add it to your strategy for backtesting.

caveat;
0. it might have bugs. no promises!!!
1. you need to add your strategy to the backtester, and use the backtester as the main body of the script - IE your strategy needs to be a subroutine or funciton of this backtester.
2. don't mess with anything. just add your strategy to the strat function (or the area where the function has been inserted to block 2)
3. don't use 'purchace rise/fall' instead EITHER set 'purchase direction TRUE/FALSE' or call the FakeCall/FakePut functions INSTEAD
4. I haven't included a 'fake Block 3 / watch your trade'. I also won't, and although I can it's largely useless as I'm only able to analyse the last 1000 candles, not every tick for all those candles anyway.
